<h1>As New Train Lines Advance, A Look Back At NYC Transit History</h1>
</div>

<div class="story">
    <h4 class="intro">By Sidney Slon</h4>

    <p class="intro">New York City is seeing a new wave of transportation updates, as construction is underway to expand the Second Avenue Subway line, and plans for the long-anticipated Interborough Expressway Line have been approved. Yet public transit has been a constantly changing feature for over two centuries, shaping the city with it.</p>

<!-- Omnibus -->

    <h5>Omnibus (Horse-Drawn Bus)</h5>
    <p>In 1800, NYC was a much smaller, more rural place. Areas like Harlem and Williamsburg were still mostly farmland, and only wealthy residents could travel by horse in private carriages. But as the population was quickly rising, horse drawn buses known as the "omnibus" opened in 1827 for mass transit. One stagecoach could hold about twelve passengers, though cobblestone and gravel streets made for a bumpy ride.</p>

    <h5>Street Trolley</h5>
    <p>Horse-drawn street cars, which followed a track, provided a much smoother transit experience. The first streetcar line opened on the Bowery in 1832, and would run until 1917.</p>
    <p>Horses powered NYC mass transit for decades, although some problems arose. The practice exposed animal abuse and filled the streets with horse manure. Steam-powered street trolleys were introduced in 1883, and electric-powered in 1890.</p>
    <p>Street trolleys were a step forward for mass transit, introducing faster and cleaner routes. Yet with more speed came higher risks. Some were designed as monorails, meaning they balanced much like a bicycle. Although quite fast, they were prone to topple over, especially along steep curves.</p>
    <p>The four-wheel trolleys were not much safer. Known as “Dead Man’s Curve” in Union Square, trolleys would speed around corners so quickly that numerous pedestrians were hit, and some killed.</p>

<!-- elevated trains -->
<div class="container icon">
    <img src="elevated.png" alt="An elevated train icon">
    <h5>Elevated Train Lines</h5>
    <p>Above the trolley lines, a larger project loomed. Opened in 1878 and pulled by steam engines, the first elevated train lines ran along Ninth, Sixth, Third and Second Avenues. Known as the “El” train, these lines were a significant feature of NYC for nearly eight decades. They could travel further than trolleys, and carry significantly more passengers.</p>
    <p>The original "El" trains were also incredibly loud, as bits of coal and ash would rain down on pedestrians below each time one passed.</p>
</div>

<!-- underground trains -->
<div class="container icon">
    <img src="underground.png" alt="A subway icon">
    <h5>Underground Subway Lines</h5>
    <p>Plans for an underground subway had been discussed since the 1860s, though it would be years until it finally opened in 1904. Building the tunnels was dangerous work, and planning was held back by contracting issues. Train lines were owned and managed by the Manhattan-based IRT, and the Brooklyn-based BRT – two private companies.</p>
    <p>However, privatization did not mean efficiency. Due to severe overcrowding in the subways by the 1920s, the IND, Independent City Owned Rapid Transit, was created under Mayor John Hylan to add competition to the market.</p>
    <p>In 1932, the first IND line opened for business after years of planning. Some riders immediately preferred the city-owned lines, as they ran faster and connected neighborhoods previously without mass transit.</p>
    <p>"Long after midnight, they were still making the turnstiles click and voicing their belief that the new Eighth Avenue line provided a fast, comfortable ride," wrote the New York Times about subway passengers on opening morning.</p>
    <p>By 1940, all three companies would merge to establish the "New York City Transit System", an earlier version of the MTA. Under the unification deal, all “El” train lines were discontinued and torn down, solidifying a new era of NYC mass transit.</p>
    <p>Today, subway lines are still being expanded and improved upon. With the current extension of the Second Avenue subway to 125th Street, much of East Harlem will gain closer access to subway stations, and transfer points.</p>

    <h5>Light Rail</h5>
    <p>The Interborough Express Line, announced by Gov. Kathy Hochul, is a 14-mile light rail that will connect 900,000 New Yorkers along the outer edges of Queens and Brooklyn to 17 different existing subway lines. It will be built along an existing, unused freight line, and may spell the future of mass transit in the outer boroughs.</p>
